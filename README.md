# WeTransfer V2 Upload wrapper

Built by myself for Python 3, because I didn't find such thing already written anywhere else...

Based on current [WeTransfer V2 API][wetransferdoc]

python > 3.5

```sh
pip install python-magic
```

# Usage
```sh
from py3wetransfer import Py3WeTransfer
x = Py3WeTransfer("xA8ZYoVox57QfxX77hjQ2AI7hqO6l9M4tqv8b57c", "transfer")
print( x.upload_file("test.zip", "test upload") )
>> "https://we.tl/t-ajQpdqGxco"
```

# TODO
  - support multiple file upload
  - support email notification (if the WeTransfer API support it really)
